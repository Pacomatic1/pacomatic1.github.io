                    // [2] is the **relative path** to the button's icon, staring from this page. Keep in mind that this icon is done with the 'src' attribute of an <img> tag inside the button tag, so make surethat your icon is suppported by the <img>. If you don't want an icon, 
                    // [3] and [4] control what the item does.
                        // If [3] is 0, then it will be a button and [3] will be a link that gets opened inside the iframe.
                        // If [2] is 1, then  it will be a button and [3] will be a link that replaces the current tab and will get rid of this whole single-page thing. I repeat, it will open in the current tab and get rid of this site.
                        // If [3] is 2, then it will be a button and [3] will be a link that opens in a new tab.
                    // [5] is the per-button styling applied to the image within the button. Just so you have a loose idea of what's what, the result will look like <img [other stuff] style="whatever you put inside 5">. As you may have guessed, this has no support for classes or anything so only use it for things that apply to one button and nobody else. If you have nothing to style with, then leave it as a blank string: ""
                    // [6] is the title of the button. It's what appears when you hover over it.
                    // [7] is the alt of the button. It's what you see when the image fails to load or if the user needs assistive technology.

                    // If it wasn't immediately obvious, this is based onthe navBar system.
