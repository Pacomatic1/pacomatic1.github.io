        Hello.
    <br>Welcome to my little place.
    <br>This is the spot with a bunch of things that <i>I</i> have posted here.
    <br>Right now, you are in the lobby, which also acts as a sitemap for this specific section.
    </p>
    <p>
      So here is the sitemap.

      Hello! It's me, from 2025! First of all, note that some of the links may be dead, but all of them (save for secrat scoop) can be accessed from other places on the site so you have nothing to worry about. Second of all, open the inspect tab. I did some stuff and I noted it all down for future reference.
