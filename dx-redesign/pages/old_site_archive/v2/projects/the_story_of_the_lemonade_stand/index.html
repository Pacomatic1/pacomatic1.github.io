   <h1>The Lemonade Stand</h1><h6>Version 1.0.0</h6>
    <p>
It was night.<br>
Inside of this endless night.
<br>The man looked at the tiny clock on the wall.
<br>It was 11:43 PM.
<br>It had been that for what seemed like an hour.
<br>Everything was still.
<br>And no matter what he tried, everything was stuck.
<br>Even if he tried to hold something, it wouldn't do a thing.
<br>Opening one of the gates in his four-sided stand, with 3 full walls and one with a half-wall,having one of those green striped patterns directly above the empty space lying on the tiny peice of wall above.
<br>It was still 11:43 in the plaza.
<br>Nobody was coming, and he was starting to drift off to sleep.
<br>Then, an hour later, there was knocking.
<br>Somebody was knocking on the counter.
<br>He steadily woke up, realizing it was 11:53 PM.
<br>The man, realizing that what had seemed like purgatory had ended, was filled with exitement.
<br>But of course, there was a customer.
<br>He had forgotten why he was here, until the customer snapped his fingers, and soon the man's attention was instantly drawn to the customer's hand.
<br>"Are you awake?"
<br>The man, just standing there, fully energized and leaning on the counter, said "Yes."
<br>"This is a Lemonade Stand, is it not?"
<br>Right at that moment, he remembered why and where he was here.
<br>"This is certainly a lemonade stand."
<br>The customer introduced himself.
<br>"I am Tochiri. Your name?"
<br>"Kochni, spelled K-O-C-H-N-I. No T."
<br>There was a pause, as 3 minutes had already passed.
<br>Finally, the pause had broke at 11:58.
<br>The pause lasted for 2 minutes.
<br>"Why are you here?" asked Kochni.
<br>"You don't know?".
<br>They stared at each other for presicely 3.8 seconds.
<br>"I'm here to order some Lemonade."
<br>Kochni knew what to do.
<br>"What do you want to order?" Kochni had politely asked.
<br>"I want all of your cups." Tochiri said, in a neutral and easygoing voice.
<br>Kochni was confused.
<br>"Why would you want my entire stock of cups?"
<br>"I have no idea."
<br>They stared, Kochni being visibly confused, and Tochiri having this look on his face which very clearly shows that he has no idea what he is doing.
<br>Kochni pulled his chair near him, because he knew he was going to be in for a long ride.
<br>All of a sudden, Tochiri instantly snapped into a very straight standing position.
<br>Then Tochiri had no idea what was going on.
<br>"What was I doing again?"
<br>"You were going to buy all of the cups, sir."
<br>Tochriri thought for a second.
<br>"Oh, it must be my short-term memory loss condition."
<br>Kochni understood.
<br>"I have had so many customers with simillar conditions."
<br>Then Tochiri started to reconsider.
<br>"What if I granted you a wish?"
<br>Kochiri quickly asked--
<br>"What about the cups?"
<br>"Don't worry abhout them."
<br>"Anyways, your wish. What are you wishing for?"
<br>Kochiri was putting a lot of thought.
<br>But then he instantly remembered: "Isn't there supposed to be some kind of catch?"
<br>"Yes. The catch is that I don't - "
<br>"What was I going to do?"
<br>Kochiri didn't want to be mean, but he didn't want this to drag on.
<br>He checked the small clock, and saw that it was 1 AM. He had to go home.
<br>"You were... Going to order some lemonade, sir."
<br>They proceeded with the order.
<br>"Are you tired or anything...?" Tochiri had asked.
<br>Wearily, Kochiri replied with "Check the time, that should explain it."
<br>Seeing that it was 1:38 AM on his watch, Tochiri realized and said "Alright, you gotta --- hey wake up!"
<br>Kochiri stood up, and Tochiri said "Go home, get some sleep."
<br>20 minutes later and Kochiri fumbled onto bed.
<br>Wasn't until 3 PM when he woke up.
<br>But time was frozen.
<br>Again.
