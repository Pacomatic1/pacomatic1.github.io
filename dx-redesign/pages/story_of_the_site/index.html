Many websites nowadays are built thanks to the **web revival** movement; all us netizens are tired of social media and the big corporations and we're bringing back our own sites and all that.
While I am involved in this movement, my website was never meant for this. Not originally.

## Chapter 1: Rayman ~~Origins~~ Legends
I like video games. This is no secret. Ever since I was a kid, I've wanted to make video games. This is no secret. <br>
Lucky for me, my *papa* was a programmer! I don't remember how this happened, but my papa roped me into making a website by giving me some *personal, hand-made* HTML classes.

Mind you, these classes weren't much: Just basic HTML and some CSS. Still, it was enough to do *something* with, and that's how I made my site, hosted on dboys.ca. Although dboys is defunct and I've redesigned my site multiple times since, you can still find it on the Old Site Archive. 
###### (TODO: ADD LINK TO THE ARCHIVE ONCE YOU... you know... make the archive)
As you can see (eventually once I make the archive ðŸ’€), it sucked. Everything was as static as can be, and the background was horrible! I couldn't do a gradient, so I did these funky block things, and the background looked terrible whenever you did anything that wasn't 16:9! Worse yet, *I knew about this.* I didn't know how to fix it though, so I just left it as-is. [I used this exact background on the old site.](./assets/original_site_bg_unmodified.avif!) Funny enough, [I put my old site on the Internet Archive back in the day](https://web.archive.org/web/20210923011913/http://dboys.ca/index.html!); if I never did this, this old design would've been lost to time. Thanks, me from 2021! <sub>I expected that to be *way* farther in the past.</sub>

As time went on, I took what I had and expanded it: More pages, more links to other platforms. However, the comically bad programming and my inability to expand it because I was using stylesheets and scripts that broke certain stuff meant that I had to do something drastic: Start anew.

## Chapter 2: Everything and nothing changed at the same time
Thanks to the new stuff I made, I gained more experience than ever before in HTML and CSS. I also used a smidgeon of Javascript that I stole off some website for the search bar. Although I found the site somewhat difficult to make, I didn't mind that. What I really hated was something completely different:

Navigation bars.

I wanted a piece of my site that would stay on-screen no matter where you went. Sadly, I didn't know how to do this. It was for this reason that my website ended up turning into the exact same thing as the last: A linktree. Don't get me wrong, it was a good looking one, but a linktree is a linktree. There's no getting around it. After I made this version of the site, I planned to make a ton more projects to fill up that searchbar area. I never did. Even so, I was content, and moved on to do other things, only ever updating it to add new social media links.

PS: If I'm not wrong, I think I wanted a navigation bar on the original site, too. Since I couldn't do it back then either, I added "Go to Sitemap" links on all of the subpages so that you could navigate back to the sitepad with minimal hassle.

## Chapter 3: I was struck by a truck, and that was a good thing
For a long, indeterminate period of time between 2021 and April 2025, almost nothing changed. The website had new links added for social media and whatnot, and dboys.ca expired so I moved to GitHub Pages, but that was it. Eventually, I found out about the web revival movement, and what people were doing on Neocities. For a while, I found it cool but otherwise didn't care. But one day, I went on my site. Then I went on their sites. Then I went on my site. Then I went on their sites.

Oh my goodness, my site *sucks!* It's so boring, it could be replaced by a linktree! It's so... it's so....
<span class="bigTextButNotAHeader">**corporate.**</span>

After deliberating for 2 days, I decided to re-build my website.

## Chapter 4: Doom came in the form of a Melon
Now here's a funny thing: In the time between then and now, I started learning more about programming. I owe a lot of that to [Dreams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreams_(video_game)!) and [LittleBigPlanet 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LittleBigPlanet_3!)'s logic system combined with [SmileBASIC 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petit_Computer!) and [Godot 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godot_(game_engine)!). In that time, I also learned a lot of C# and some C++.
All in all, I new more. A lot more than I did before. My extra knowledge played a huge part in how the new site worked, because I stopped relying entirely on HTML and CSS and started to embrace Javascript with open arms. As I learned more and more about web development, I had a genius idea: "What if I had everything on a single HTML page, and then loaded whatever you need using [iframes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/iframe!) and [query strings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_string!)?"
I had conceptualized a whole new idea: [Something that already exists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application!). That's right: I conceptualized the iframe-based single-page application, something that existed long before I was born.

This solved all of my problems: I got to have a website with multiple pages, and I got to have a piece of it that stayed around no matter where I went! Plus, I could even use a global stylesheet and global script to make sure that all of them had a consistent style!
As for what I was to do, I based it off of 3 things: [medjed.nekoweb.org](./assets/medjed.png!), [PrismLauncher](./assets/prismlauncher.png!), and [7.css](https://khang-nd.github.io/7.css/!).
I built a simple query string system, using a lookup table to get the page you're on and choose a specific iframe as well as a background for this. 
I did things by modifying *the compiled version* of 7.css for, only for me to realize that  
            `;

            // Pre-processor
            var preprocessedArticle = theArticle;
            

            var parsedText = marked.parse(preprocessedArticle);
            // Post-post-processor (marked already has its own post-processor)


            mdTempContainer.innerHTML = parsedText;
            
            // Post-Injection processor (post-post-post processor) 
            var anchorTags = mdTempContainer.querySelectorAll('a');
            for (let i = 0; i < anchorTags.length; i++) {
                var tagToMod = anchorTags[i]; 
                
                if (tagToMod.href.endsWith("!")) {
                    tagToMod.target = "_blank";
                    tagToMod.href = tagToMod.href.substring(0, tagToMod.href.length - 1);
                }
            }
            
            // The end!
            mdContainer.innerHTML = mdTempContainer.innerHTML;
