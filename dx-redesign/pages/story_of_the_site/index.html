## Preamble
Many websites nowadays are built thanks to the **web revival** movement; all us netizens are tired of social media and the big corporations and we're bringing back our own sites and all that. <br>
While I am involved in this movement, my website was never meant for this. Not originally.

## The Beginning
I like video games. This is no secret. Ever since I was a kid, I've wanted to make video games. This is no secret. <br>
Lucky for me, my *papa* was a programmer! I don't remember how this happened, but my papa roped me into making a website by giving me some *personal, hand-made* HTML classes.

Mind you, these classes weren't much: Just basic HTML and some CSS. Still, it was enough to do *something* with, and that's how I made my site, hosted on dboys.ca. Although dboys is defunct and I've redesigned my site multiple times since, you can still find it on the Old Site Archive. 
###### (TODO: ADD LINK TO THE ARCHIVE ONCE YOU... you know... make the archive)
As you can see (eventually once I make the archive ðŸ’€), it sucked. Everything was as static as can be, and the background was horrible! I couldn't do a gradient, so I did these funky block things, and the background looked terrible whenever you did anything that wasn't 16:9! Worse yet, *I knew about this.* I didn't know how to fix it though, so I just left it as-is. [I used this exact background on the old site.](./assets/original_site_bg_unmodified.avif!) Funny enough, [I put my old site on the Internet Archive back in the day](https://web.archive.org/web/20210923011913/http://dboys.ca/index.html!); if I never did this, this old design would've been lost to time. Thanks, me from 2021! <sub>I expected that to be *way* farther in the past.</sub>

As time went on, I took what I had and expanded it: More pages, more links to other platforms. However, the comically bad programming and my inability to expand it because I was using stylesheets and scripts that broke certain stuff meant that I had to do something drastic: Start anew.

## New Website, New Frustrations
Thanks to the new stuff I made, I gained more experience than ever before in HTML and CSS. I also used a smidgeon of Javascript that I stole off some website for the search bar. Although I found the site somewhat difficult to make, I didn't mind that. What I really hated was something completely different:

Navigation bars.

I wanted a piece of my site that would stay on-screen no matter where you went. Sadly, I didn't know how to do this. It was for this reason that my website ended up turning into the exact same thing as the last: A linktree.
Don't get me wrong, it was a good looking one, but a linktree is a linktree. There's no getting around it. After I made this version of the site, I planned to make a ton more projects to fill up that searchbar area. I never did.
Even so, I was content, and moved on to do other things, only ever updating it to add new social media links.

PS: If I'm not wrong, I think I wanted a navigation bar on the original site, too. Since I couldn't do it back then either, I added "Go to Sitemap" links on all of them so that you could navigate back to the sitepad with minimal hassle.
