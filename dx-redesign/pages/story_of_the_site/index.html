## Preamble
Many websites nowadays are built thanks to the **web revival** movement; all us netizens are tired of social media and the big corporations and we're bringing back our own sites and all that.

While I am involved in this movement, my website was never meant for this. Not originally.

## The Beginning
I like video games. This is no secret. Ever since I was a kid, I've wanted to make video games. This is no secret. \n
Lucky for me, my *papa* was a programmer! I don't remember how this happened, but my papa roped me into making a website by giving me some *personal, hand-made* HTML classes.

Mind you, these classes weren't much: Just basic HTML and some CSS. Still, it was enough to do *something* with, and that's how I made my site, hosted on dboys.ca. Although dboys is defunct and I've redesigned my site multiple times since, you can still find it on the Old Site Archive. 
###### (TODO: ADD LINK TO THE ARCHIVE ONCE YOU... you know... make the archive)
As you can see (eventually once I make the archive ðŸ’€), it sucked. Everything was as static as can be, and the background was horrible! I couldn't do a gradient, so I did these funky block things, and the background looked terrible whenever you did anything that wasn't 16:9! Worse yet, *I knew about this.* I didn't know how to fix it though, so I just left it as-is. [I used this exact background on the old site.](./assets/original_site_bg_unmodified.avif) Funny enough, [I put my old on the Internet Archive back in the day](https://web.archive.org/web/20210923011913/http://dboys.ca/index.html); if I [^1] never did this *vain*(?) action, this old design would've been lost to time. Thanks, me from 2021! <sub>I expected that to be *way* farther in the past.</sub>

[^1]: Don't use the Internet Archive version, as it lacks a ton of stuff and it's super slow. Use the Old Site Archive Version instead.
