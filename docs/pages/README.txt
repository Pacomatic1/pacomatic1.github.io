Here are some things that all pages REQUIRE. Don't skip this stuff!

1. Place this in the head: <script src="../shared.js"> </script>
    This is an essential script that every page needs to communicate with the parent page.
    Also keep in mind that this path is based on something being in a direct child of the 'pages' folder (eg. "/pages/home/index.html"). If you want to have an iframe in a subfolder (eg. "/pages/home/stats/index.html") then adjust the path accordingly and all will be well.
