<!-- No indentation. I'd say I was naive, but my papa made this and very obviously rushed it. 
It's insane to find what's changed in the last... 8? 9? years? I am writing this at 15 and this was made when I was in grade 4.

At least 6 years has passed. I feel old at 15, this can only mean bad things. -->
