<p>It's time to get serious! First, we'll try some text formatting.<br>We gotta be <strong>bold</strong>. We gotta be <em>ital</em>- actually, who am I kidding? Nobody carea about this, we already know it. We want something more.<br>We wanna be <wavy time=".1" distance=".4rem">wavy!</wavy> No. We gotta be <wavy time=".08" distance="3rem"> SUPER WAVY!!! </wavy><br>And we need <a href="https://example.com">hyperlinks</a>. Lot's of 'em!<br>Oh, and some should open <a href="https://example.com!">externally</a> too. That one was an external site.<br>Here's an <a href="../hello_world_copy/index.html!">internal</a> one too. Still opens in a new tab.</p>
