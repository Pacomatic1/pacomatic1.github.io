# Okay, no more messaing about.
It's time to get serious! First, we'll try some text formatting.
We gotta be **bold**. We gotta be *ital*- actually, who am I kidding? Nobody carea about this, we already know it. We want something more.
We wanna be <wavy time="1s" distance=".4rem"><span class="wavyText">w</span><span>a</span><span>v</span><span>y</span><span>!</span></wavy> No. We gotta be <wavy time="1s" distance = ".3rem"> **SUPER** *WAVY*!!! </wavy>
And we need [hyperlinks](https://example.com). Lot's of 'em!
\</wavy></wavy\>
Oh, and some should open [externally](https://example.com!) too. That one was an external site.
Here's an [internal](../hello_world_copy/index.html) one too. Still opens in a new tab.
